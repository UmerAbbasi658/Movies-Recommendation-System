# Description
This project aims to build a recommendation system that suggests items (e.g., movies, books, products) to users based on two different techniques: popularity-based and content-based recommendation.

# Popularity-based Recommendation: 
This technique recommends the most popular items to all users. It does not take into account the specific interests or preferences of individual users but instead suggests items based on their overall popularity within the entire user base.

# Content-based Recommendation:
 This technique recommends items to users based on the features of the items and the preferences of the users. It analyzes the attributes or content of the items and recommends items that are similar to those that a user has liked in the past.

# Features
Implementation of popularity-based recommendation algorithm.
Implementation of content-based recommendation algorithm.
Integration of both techniques into a unified recommendation system.
Example datasets and usage instructions.
Dependencies
Python (>=3.0)
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn (for content-based recommendation)
